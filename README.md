Full stack doctor reservation system built on RMI Archictcure client-aerver, it is a group project and my part in it is related 
to implmenting Appointments crud operations in the back end as you can add, update or delete your appointments and you can 
view all avilable appointments to make a resrvation, javax mail library was used here to sedn actual emails to the users 
and it was immplmented so it can be used with another methods as well. the other part i took care of was the insurancre logic 
and implmentation. and all of these controllers has its own gui so there is complete intergartaion between the front-end and the 
backend.
